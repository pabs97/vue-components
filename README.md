# Carousel
### TODO
1. Make the window size adjustable to allow for number of elements (instead of width size)
2. Add option that ensures the last scroll is full of elements
    For example, if our window size was 4 and our elements were [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], the window after the last scroll should be [6,7,8,9] and not [8,9,empty,empty]
3. Use CSS Scroll Snapping instead of JS https://css-tricks.com/practical-css-scroll-snapping/
4. Use list items (semantic html)

# Pagination
### TODO
1. use Number instead of Array for pageList
2. create the href in the template
    Something like
    href="?page/2"
3. Use list items (semantic html)
